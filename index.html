		<h2>Here's some facts about me.</h2>
		<p id="text">I am Rifqi Arief and currently I manage several local ISPs (Internet Service Provider) for a living. The scope is core routers (e.g. BGP, etc.), recursive DNS, hypervisors, etc.</p>
		<p id="text">I live in Indonesia, precisely in the city of <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/tFC5aK9LnWBmkwZz8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">East Jakarta</a>.</p>
		<p id="text">My current interest is in using <a href="https://fd.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FD.io VPP</a> as the data-plane for a <a href="https://net.rap.my.id/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">small network I own</a>. Additionally, I use <a href="https://bird.nic.cz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BIRD2</a> as the control-plane (BGP) due to its unmatched performance and having small footprints.</p>
		<p id="text">I'm a staunch supporter of open source solutions. While I can't offer much support right now, I'm a strong supporter of open source, especially when it comes to networking solutions.</p>
		<p id="text">I really like using Debian as a server operating system because of its undeniable qualities.</p>
		<p id="text">I really love Japanese anime, especially those with the "isekai" (another world) genre. Honestly, I'm tired of living in this world, so I really like that kind of genre.</p>
		<p id="text">My current goal is to find a way to live "comfortably". This is because the house I currently live in isn't entirely mine or my parents. It's an inheritance from my grandmother.</p>
		<p id="text">Currently, my father's older & younger sister are asking to sell it immediately, even though they have already earned a better living than my family :). (My salary isn't as big as you might think. But life must go on.)</p>
		<p id="text">Why life always not fair? I even questioning myself "why" almost every single day.</p>

		<h3>This site is ugly</h3>
		<p>Yes, to be honest I am not someone who can do modern web design because of my bad taste. <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">But it works</a>.</p>
