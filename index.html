		<h1>Hello!</h1>

	<h2>Here's some facts about me.</h2>
	<p>I am Rifqi Arief and currently I manage several local ISPs (Internet Service Provider) for a living.</p>
	<p>I live in Indonesia, precisely in the city of <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/tFC5aK9LnWBmkwZz8">East Jakarta</a>.</p>
	<p>My current interest is in using <a href="https://fd.io/">FD.io VPP</a> as the data-plane for a <a href="https://net.rap.my.id/">small network I own</a>. Additionally, I use <a href="https://bird.nic.cz/">BIRD2</a> as the control-plane (BGP) due to its unmatched performance and having small footprints.</p>
	<p>I'm a staunch supporter of open source solutions. While I can't offer much support right now, I'm a strong supporter of open source, especially when it comes to networking solutions.</p>
	<p>I really like using Debian as a server operating system because of its undeniable qualities.</p>
	<p>I really love Japanese anime, especially those with the "isekai" (another world) genre. Honestly, I'm tired of living in this world, so I really like that kind of genre.</p>
	<p>My current goal is to find a way to live comfortably. This is because the house I currently live in isn't entirely mine or my parents. It's an inheritance from my grandmother.</p>

	<p>Yes, to be honest I am not someone who can do modern web design because of my bad taste. <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com">But it works</a>.</p>
